# This is a Multi level feed back queue scheduler for operating system. It is based on the following rules
`Rule 1:` If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs (B doesnâ€™t).

`Rule 2:` If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A & B run in round-robin fashion using the time slice (quantum length) of the given queue.

`Rule 3:` When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue).

`Rule 4:` Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU), its priority is  reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).

`Rule 5:` After some time period S, move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue.

# How to compile
1. run `make`
2. it will create executables `scheduler`
3. run program using `./scheduler #cpu S filename` (e.g.  ./scheduler 2 3200 tasks.txt)
4. run `make clean` to remove executables

# Questions
1. How does the value of S affect turnaround time and response time? Is the difference in turnaround time and response time what you expected to see as S and the number of CPUs change? Why or why not?
- From the table above, We can see that Higher S value causes higher turn around time and response time. As the number of CPUs increases, overall system performance improves, resulting in shorter execution times. This enhancement can be attributed to parallelism, allowing multiple tasks to be processed simultaneously.Regarding the time quantum S, the observed reduction in execution times may stem from the fact that longer tasks have increased opportunities for execution. With smaller time quanta, processes are preempted more frequently, enabling the scheduler to allocate CPU time to a greater number of tasks.

2. How does adjusting the S value in the system affect the turnaround time or response time for long-running and I/O tasks specifically? Does it appear to be highly correlated?
-The correlation between S and turnaround/response times is not necessarily straightforward. When i increase S it appears that at some point  turn around and response time decrease for long-running task and I/O task ,  afterwards i incraese S value more,  then it started increasing turn around time and response time for the tasks. So, it seems that long job will eventually starve for more higher S value.
